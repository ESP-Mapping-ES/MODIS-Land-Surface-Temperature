The MODIS Surface Temperature tool has been created by the [Remote Sensing Lab](https://http://rslab.gr/) in Hellas, Greece. The MODIS Land Surface Temperature is a Google Earth Engine based tool that provides up-to-date Land Surface Temperature at 1 x 1 Km. Averages from the daily MODIS LST products for the entire globe are available to visualize and download here. You select a time interval, draw a polygon in your area of interest, visualize, download, or see charts for your data.
